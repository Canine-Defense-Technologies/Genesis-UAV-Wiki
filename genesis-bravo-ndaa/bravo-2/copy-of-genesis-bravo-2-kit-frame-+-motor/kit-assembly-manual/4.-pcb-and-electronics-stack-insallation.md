{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that the solder joints are. Check that the solder joint:

* Have a consistent shiny surface
* The pads on both components are evenly covered with solder
* Solder is pooled within the joints
* Have a round liquid puddled shape
* There is no bridging
* There is no splatter or droplets near the joint that could interfere with the components on the ESC
* There is no excess solder pooling off the joint
