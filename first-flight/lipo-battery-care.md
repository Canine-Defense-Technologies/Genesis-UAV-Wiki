# LiPo Battery Care







* **NEVER exceed a charge rate of 2C!** (2C is 2 times the battery capacity to get the charge current. Ex: 2C of a 1000 mah battery is 2 Amps)
* **NEVER discharge the battery below a cell voltage of 3.0v.**
* **NEVER charge a battery unattended.**
* **NEVER charge a battery without a fireproof box or bag from a reputable manufacturer.**
* **NEVER charge or fly visibly damaged batteries.**
* **NEVER discard batteries into the regular trash.**
* **NEVER put the batteries in a hot area.**
* **NEVER puncture or drop the batteries.**
* **DO NOT store the batteries fully charged.**
* **DO NOT store the batteries at a low voltage.**
* **STORE the batteries at its storage cell voltage** (3.8v per cell, multiply by your S rating. Ex. 4S battery = storage voltage of 15.2v)
* **STORE the batteries in a fireproof battery bag or box.**
* **STORE the batteries in a dry and temperature-stable area.**
