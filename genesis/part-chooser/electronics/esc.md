# ESC

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of April 2025, this page is stored for archival purposes. K9 has replaced the Genesis drone family to the newly improved Genesis Bravo 3.

ESCs or Electronic Speed Controllers are what drives the brushless DC motors on a drone. Genesis is designed to use any 30x30 4 in 1 ESC on the market. ESCs will determine the agility, flight performance, speed, and max payload of a drone. It's recommended to select an ESC with a total current rating higher than what is expected to be drawn. To make things easier, below are ESCs we recommend for your Genesis build.
