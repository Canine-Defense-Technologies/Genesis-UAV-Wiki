Throughout the manual the "front" and "back of the drone will be referenced. The easiest way to identify the "rear" or "back" of the drone is by the two antenna SMA ports in the back.&#x20;

## Step 4: Checking&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that the solder joints are. Check that the solder joint:

* Have a consistent shiny surface
* The pads on both components are evenly covered with solder
* Solder is pooled within the joints
* Have a round liquid puddled shape
* There is no bridging
* There is no splatter or droplets near the joint that could interfere with the components on the ESC
* There is no excess solder pooling off the joint
